**About the project**
First thing you need to know what is `fractal` and their equations like `mandelbrot set` `julia set` `burning ship` and so on. the idea of this project is to draw a computer graphical fractal using `mlx` or `minilibx` `minilibx 42` library *link in Resources* like `Mandelbrot` Set and `julia Set` and after that you can draw any fractal you want, the main idea is how to use the graphic library and learning about its functions and how they work.

#### Mandelbrot Set

> Mandelbrot Set The term Mandelbrot set is used to refer both to a general class of fractal sets and to a particular instance of such a set. In general, a Mandelbrot set marks the set of points in the complex plane such that the corresponding Julia set is connected and not computable.

#### Julia Set

> Julia set fractals are normally generated by initializing a complex number  z = x + yi  where  i2 = -1  and x and y are image pixel coordinates in the range of about -2 to 2. Then, z is repeatedly updated using:  z = z2 + c  where c is another complex number that gives a specific Julia set. After numerous iterations, if the magnitude of z is less than 2 we say that pixel is in the Julia set and color it accordingly. Performing this calculation for a whole grid of pixels gives a fractal image.

#### Burning Ship 
> Burningship The Burning Ship Fractal is a slight variant on the Mandelbrot Set Fractal.
The basic Mandelbrot Fractal formula is z=z^2+c. The Burning Ship Fractal formula is z=abs(z)^2+c.
